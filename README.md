# Amiga GBA1000 Project

The GB A1000 is a motherboard based on the Amiga 1000. The project was developed by Georg Braun and has the following features:

* CPU: Motorola MC68030 at 40 or 50 MHz
* FPU: Motorola MC68881 or MC68882 at CPU-speed
* RAM: 8 Mbyte 32-bit SRAM, 2 Mbyte ChipRAM
* Chipset: ECS Amiga (ECS-Denise 8373 and Fat Agnus 8372/8375)
* Built-in flicker-fixer with VGA-output
* One Zorro-II slot
* 1 Mbyte Flash-ROM for optional software
* Real-time clock with battery backup
* IDE-controller
* Two Kickstart-sockets
* Fits directly into an original Amiga 1000 case

I will attempt to build a GBA1000 this year, this repo will host all the information and research work needed.
